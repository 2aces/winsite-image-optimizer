Image compression for WordPress done right.

== Description ==

Winsite Image Optimizer will compress your images for optimal file-size while keeping its quality (pretty much) intact, using the ImageOptim API (and other processing engines coming up soon).

You can also process all of your old images retroactively using our dedicated tool, found under the Media section.

**Currently-implemented Image Processing Services:**

* ImageOptim
